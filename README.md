# ChatBuddy – A Simple Chatbot in Python

 ***About the Project***
ChatBuddy is a simple rule-based chatbot built with Python and NLTK. It responds to greetings, questions about its name, and simple small talk using keyword-based intent detection. The chatbot runs in a terminal and demonstrates basic natural language processing.

***Tools and Libraries Used***
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **NLTK** – For tokenizing and processing input
- **Tkinter** – To build the GUI interface
- **Random & Datetime** – For varied responses and timestamps
- **VS Code** – Used as the code editor

***How It Works***
1. Run the chatbot.
2. Type your message in the terminal.
3. The bot replies based on detected intent (e.g., greeting, goodbye, thanks).

*** How to Run***
1. Install NLTK if not already installed:

 ***How to Run***
1. Install NLTK: ```bash
   pip install nltk

***What I Learned***
- Basic natural language processing using NLTK
- Creating a rule-based chatbot
- Keyword matching and random responses

***Features***
- Mini chat window using Tkinter
- Color-coded chat messages
- Recognizes my name ("Helly") and that i'm the admin
- Responds to small talk (e.g., "how are you?", "what are you doing?")

***OUTPUT***
